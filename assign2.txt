Assign2: Due 11:59PM March 7

***Please review the top part of ../hw1/hw1.txt***
***Your chance of success greatly increases if you start very early. Your chance of failure increases if you start late.

Take small steps. Start with a canary test and one or two more tests.
List your tests in a file named tests.txt. Check them off with a x as you 
implement them. Remember to ask for a review each day. The earlier you start,
the earlier you finish, and less the risk. If you start late, you carry a 
bigger risk. Now to the assignment.
                                                                         
We will write a program that will print in the following example format the details about the ISS:

******************************
ISS location as 11:15PM CT flying over Baltimore, MD

There are 4 people on ISS at this time:
firstname1 lastname1
firstname2 lastname2
firstname3 lastname3
firstname4 lastname4
******************************

The names should appear in the sorted by lastname order.

Write the program in a way that it gracefully deals with network failures and also failure of the webservice. Also, write the program in such a way that if we decide to change the webservice that provides the information, the change will affect as little code as possible.

Total [100]: 81
Program executes - via run task[10]: -2

Program works as expected [10]: -10

There are 9 people on ISS at this time:

Names not in sorted order. From assign2.txt: "The names should appear in the sorted by lastname order."

Programm gracefully handles network failure [10]:
All tests pass [10]:
Test coverage [10]:
Test quality [10]:

Design quality, good separation of concerns [20]: -1
Some of the files need to be merged instead of related code being split across files.

Got tests for middle name [5]: -5

Code quality [15]: -1
Need better names for files to convey quickly their specific intent/content.
