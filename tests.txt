x canary tests

x get_location returns the time and location that the service returns

x get_location returns a string "service failed to respond" if the service throws an exception
x get_location returns a string "network error: service unreachable" if the service throws an exception

x get_astronauts returns empty list if service returns empty list
x get_astronauts returns list with one name if service returns a list with one name
x get_astronauts returns list with two names if service returns a list with two names already in sorted order

x get_astronauts returns list with two names in sorted order if service returns a list with two names in unsorted order

x get_astronauts returns list with two names in sorted order if service returns a list with two names where the last names are the same but first names are different and in unsorted order

x get_astronauts returns a string "network error: service unreachable" if the service throws an exception
x get_astronauts returns a string "service failed to respond" if the service throws an exception

x get response returns response from the webservice for astronauts names

x parse response returns astronauts names for ISS from the given sample data
x parse response returns astronauts names  for ISS from the another sample data

x get astronauts names calls the above two functions
x get astronauts throws an exception if get response throws an exception
x get astronauts throws an exception if parse response throws an exception

x get response returns response from the webservice for time and location

x parse response returns timestamp and location from the given sample data
x parse response returns timestamp and location from the another sample data

x timestamp_to_ct returns formatted time given timestamp
x timestamp_to_ct returns formatted time given another timestamp

x get location calls the above two functions
x get location returns the time in CT instead of the time stamp

x get location also returns the place (city/state) of iss

x get location throws an exception if get response throws an exception
x get location throws an exception if parse response throws an exception

x parse city and state takes address and returns city and state code
x parse city and state takes another address and returns city and state code

x reverse geocode takes lat and lon and returns the location
x reverse geocode takes another lat and lon and returns the location
x reverse geocode takes another lat and lon and returns the unrecognized location

x reverse geocode throws exception if network error happens


x Let's write a program to print the details we expect, using the functions we designed so far
x Let's modify the build so that when we run
x paver
 it runs the tests
x paver run
 it executes the program.
